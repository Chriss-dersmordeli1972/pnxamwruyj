Mountainhead. Wow. Just wow. I just staggered out of the theater and it feels like my mind’s been tap-danced on by a caffeinated kangaroo—or maybe it's just the popcorn overdose. Still, it’s got me thinking... or trying to. Is this what a film is supposed to do? Make you question your entire existence? Because, if I'm being honest, I came for some mindless escapism, a chance to drool at stunning visuals and maybe drool in my sleep. But nope, got a full philosophical smackdown instead. Thanks for that.

Somewhere between the jagged cliffs and deep blue skies, I started wondering if I'd left the iron on or if I’d ever find socks that NEVER disappear in the wash. But also—what the heck was this film really about? Adventures? Finding yourself? A weird flex about climbing dangerous rocks? Or just an arty way of saying 'look at mountains, contemplate life, go home, question everything'? Funny how my brain just does wild things.

> Couldn’t decide if the lead actor was inspiring or just… there. Kind of like an overripe avocado, good for one thing but past its prime for everything else. Speaking of avocados, what happened to that bag I bought last week? Anyway, the film. Right. The cinematography was stunning—those peaks were practically punching me in the eyeballs with beauty—but even so, half the time I just wanted them to yell at the screen, “DUDE, DON’T. YOU’RE NOT A GOAT!”

Anyway, random thought: am I supposed to download this movie now and dissect the metaphors during my next existential crisis? Is this what people do? I half expected the credits to roll and reveal it was all some abstract ad for climbing gear. 

Here’s some little coding tidbit that popped into my head, unrelated to everything—just like it belongs in my brain:

```python
mountain_height = 8848
for climb in range(1, mountain_height):
    print(Climb a bit higher... or maybe not  climb)
```

Honestly, do I recommend it? How do I even know anymore? Go watch the movie if you want your brain tied in a knot and untied again on a scenic route. Maybe you're into that kind of mental workout. In the end, I guess it’s hard to deny—it crawled inside my head, rewired some things, and left its mark like mismatched laces on a rainy day, whether I liked it or not.
